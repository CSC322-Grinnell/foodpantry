MICA Food Pantry Website
==========

Foster community awareness of local food pantry needs towards more timely and appropriate donations.

Live production website available at http://guarded-sea-4243.herokuapp.com

To install and run from a preconfigured VM: 

    git clone https://github.com/CSC322-Grinnell/foodpantry
    bundle install â€“-without production
    rake db:setup (which runs db:migrate and db:seed in one step, making individual calls redundant)
    rake cucumber
    rake spec
    rails server

Installation steps for a MathLAN computer are similar, but with 'bundle exec' added and 'bundle-install-user' along with the setup script to configure the environment.
    git clone https://github.com/CSC322-Grinnell/foodpantry
    bundle-install-user
    bundle exec rake db:setup
    bundle exec rake cucumber
    bundle exec rake spec
    rails s
