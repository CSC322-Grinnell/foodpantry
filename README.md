Iteration 3 retrospective:
What went well:
People took initiative and got more work done independently than as a group X2
Got in communication with people to get necessary information
PivotalTracker velocity is more easily understood, on track with our progress


What went poorly:
Possible lack of communication, organization 
problems that only one or few people understand
Took a long time for MICA response

What we can do better:
meet and discuss changes that were made independently so the whole group is on the same page
better/more assertive communication with partner
